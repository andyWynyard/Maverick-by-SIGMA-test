# Maverick-by-SIGMA-test
Small test application for Maverick by SIGMA. 

---
This is a little test application for you to build. It isnt so much to test your skill in programing, but more to see how you think through a problem. 

## Your task is to build a todo list that works. You should be able to add todo's and remove them. 

__No framework should be used to build this,__ simple __HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JavaScript__ is to be used. However, as __jQuery__ is pretty much ubiquitous to JS, you can use that also. The example image below is to represent a super basic template, and you should use your creativity to build on this. 

Try to think about two specific areas:
1. What would make the user experience simpler or more obvious.
2. What could you add to this to make the application smarter? Subtle hint: ```localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));```

You will also notice that there is a header with menu, and a "footer" element with basic icons, and spacing. Jump into this and do whatever you think appropriate. Make sure you push to this repository in stages, and keep the messages to the point.

#### Make sure to have fun with this. We're sure you will do well.

To get going: 
1. Clone the repository, however you like, to your own repository.
2. Build the app, in stages.
3. Push out a final version to your own repo, and let us know.

## Happy building!!
